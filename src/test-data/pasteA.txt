TEST PASTE A

// STEP 1: Copy this entire block and paste it into a new file.
// EXPECTED: The entire file should be highlighted as un-reviewed.

// STEP 2: "Review" this function by moving your cursor inside this block or selecting it.
// EXPECTED: The highlight on these lines (10-14) should disappear, 
//           and remain not highlighted after pasting TEST PASTE B.

// This is an intermediate block of code that will remain un-reviewed.
// It should be highlighted after both the first and second paste.

// STEP 3: "Review" this function by moving your cursor inside this block or selecting it.
// EXPECTED: The highlight on these lines (29-32) should disappear,
//           but should be highlighted after paste of TEST PLAN B, as they have changed

}

// STEP 4: Now, with both functions reviewed (un-highlighted),
// replace the entire file content with "TEST PASTE B".
