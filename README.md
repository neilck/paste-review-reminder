# Paste Review Reminder

A Visual Studio Code extension that helps you remember to review code that was pasted or generated by AI assistants.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Monitors your files for rapid text insertions (paste or AI-generated code)
- **Visual Reminders**: Wraps detected code blocks in `//#region` comments with TODO reminders
- **Highlighted Code**: Applies background highlighting to remind you to review the code
- **Easy Dismissal**: Click the "Dismiss Review Reminder" CodeLens to remove the reminder once reviewed
- **Configurable**: Customize the minimum line count, detection threshold, and highlight color

## How It Works

The extension monitors text changes in your files. When it detects:

1. A block of text inserted at 110+ characters per second (configurable)
2. With 20+ lines (configurable)

It will automatically:

1. Wrap the code in `//#region TODO: review generated/pasted code` and `//#endregion` comments
2. Highlight the lines with a background color
3. Add a CodeLens "Dismiss Review Reminder" button above the region

## Configuration

You can customize the extension's behavior in your VS Code settings:

- `pasteReviewReminder.minimumLines`: Minimum number of lines to trigger a reminder (default: 20)
- `pasteReviewReminder.characterThreshold`: Characters per second threshold to detect paste/AI (default: 110)
- `pasteReviewReminder.highlightColor`: Background color for highlighted regions (default: rgba(255, 200, 100, 0.15))

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. Write or paste code as usual
3. When you paste or generate a large block of code, it will be automatically marked for review
4. Review the code when you're ready
5. Click "Dismiss Review Reminder" to remove the markers

- TypeScript/JavaScript (and React variants)
- C#
- Python
