# Paste Review Reminder

A Visual Studio Code extension that helps you remember to review code that was pasted or generated by AI assistants.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Monitors your files for rapid text insertions (paste or AI-generated code)
- **Visual Highlights**: Applies background highlighting to remind you to review the code
- **Interactive Dismissal**: Simply move your cursor to a highlighted line to dismiss it
- **Smart Region Splitting**: Regions automatically split when you dismiss middle lines
- **Persistent Highlights**: Highlights survive VS Code restarts
- **Easy Cleanup**: Click the "Dismiss All Review Highlights" CodeLens to remove entire regions
- **Configurable**: Customize the minimum line count, detection threshold, and highlight color

## How It Works

The extension monitors text changes in your files. When it detects:

1. A block of text inserted at 110+ characters per second (configurable)
2. With 20+ lines (configurable)

It will automatically:

1. Highlight the lines with a background color
2. Add a "❌ Dismiss All Review Highlights" CodeLens button at the first highlighted line
3. Save the highlights so they persist across sessions

## Usage

### Automatic Highlighting

1. Paste or AI-generate a large block of code
2. Lines are immediately highlighted
3. CodeLens appears at the first highlighted line

### Dismissing Highlights

**Method 1: Move cursor** (dismiss individual lines)

- Simply move your cursor to any highlighted line
- That line is immediately unhighlighted
- If you create a gap, the region splits into multiple regions

**Method 2: Click CodeLens** (dismiss entire region)

- Click "❌ Dismiss All Review Highlights" above the region
- All highlights in that region are removed

**Method 3: Command Palette**

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- Type "Dismiss Review Highlights"
- Dismisses the region containing your cursor

## Configuration

You can customize the extension's behavior in your VS Code settings:

- `pasteReviewReminder.minimumLines`: Minimum number of lines to trigger a reminder (default: 20)
- `pasteReviewReminder.characterThreshold`: Characters per second threshold to detect paste/AI (default: 110)
- `pasteReviewReminder.highlightColor`: Background color for highlighted regions (default: rgba(255, 200, 100, 0.15))

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. Write or paste code as usual
3. When you paste or generate a large block of code, it will be automatically highlighted
4. Review the code at your convenience
5. Move your cursor through the highlighted lines to dismiss them one-by-one, or
6. Click "Dismiss All Review Highlights" to remove the entire region

## Supported Languages

The extension works with **all file types** - no language-specific configuration needed!
